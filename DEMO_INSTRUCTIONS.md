🚀 AI Blog Assistant: Automating the Future of Technical Content

Following up on my goal to build a modular AI-powered innovation lab, I'm excited to introduce the AI Blog Assistant—a tool I built to automate the creation of research summaries, technical blogs, and SEO-ready content.

🧠 Why I Built It
As developers, we spend countless hours digesting technical papers, experimenting, and writing documentation. But sharing our insights publicly often takes a back seat. The AI Blog Assistant solves this by turning structured notes, papers, or ideas into coherent, high-quality blog posts—automatically.

🛠 What It Does
✅ Takes input (bullet points, markdown notes, or PDFs)
✅ Uses GPT to generate summaries, tutorials, or commentary in a chosen tone (explanatory, concise, humorous, etc.)
✅ Automatically embeds key terms, links, and SEO meta-structure
✅ Supports one-click publishing (Notion/Markdown export ready)

📈 Impact on Workflow
✅ Reduced blog creation time by 70%
✅ Enabled daily posting with consistent quality
✅ Increased knowledge retention by forcing structured summarization
✅ Opened the door to multi-language publishing & cross-platform sharing

🌐 Tech Stack
React · GPT API · SEO Schema · Markdown Renderer · Flask Backend (soon to be FastAPI)

Coming soon: integration with arXiv, S2ORC, and image captioning via BLIP

🧩 Part of a Bigger System
This assistant is one module of my broader effort to build plug-and-play tools, including:
📊 AI Stock Sentiment Tracker
🧪 AI-Accelerated DOE for Engineering
🖼 3D MCP Model Generator
🎛 UI Mockup Generator

💬 Let's Share Knowledge Better
I believe tech is best advanced not only by building, but by communicating ideas well. This tool is my attempt to bridge that gap—and I'm happy to open-source it or co-develop it further with researchers, bloggers, and dev teams.
